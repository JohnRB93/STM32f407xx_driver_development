# STM32f407xx_driver_development

Driver code development for the STM32f407VG microcontroller.
The goal of this project is to implement a library(not using HAL) that an application can use to interact with the microcontroller.

Images and videos of results of user applications can be found/downloaded from the media directory.

Below is what my board looks like:
